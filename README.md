# Early-Diabetes-Detection
Conducting data analysis on early diabetes detection using the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository

I have split this project into 3 parts:
- Part 1: Data collection and cleaning
- Part 2: Data visualization and statistics
- Part 3: Machine learning and model training

This project was done on Jupyter notebooks, with each part being in a separate notebook

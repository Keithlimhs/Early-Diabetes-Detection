# Early-Diabetes-Detection
Conducting data analysis on early diabetes detection using the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository

I have split this project into 3 parts:
- Part 1: Data collection and cleaning
- Part 2: Data visualization and statistics
- Part 3: Machine learning and model training

For part 3 of the project, I explored 3 machine learning models: Logistic regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Based on the confusion matrix and classification reports generated after fitting and predicting data, it turns out that Decision Tree yielded the highest accuracy for predicting diabetes status. 

This project was done on Jupyter notebooks, with each part being in a separate notebook. This is a basic level machine learning project to get me started on data analytics
